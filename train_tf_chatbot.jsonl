{"text": "USER: Can I analyze multiple TFs at once?\nBOT: Currently, the tool supports one TF at a time, but future versions will support batch input."}
{"text": "USER: What is a TF-target network?\nBOT: It's a visual graph showing which genes are regulated by a specific transcription factor."}
{"text": "USER: What is the role of logomaker in this tool?\nBOT: Logomaker is used to visualize PWM motifs as DNA logos showing nucleotide preferences."}
{"text": "USER: Which GUI framework did you use?\nBOT: The GUI is built using PyQt5, which supports responsive desktop applications."}

{"text": "USER: What are E-scores?\nBOT: E-scores are metrics used to evaluate TF-target affinity. In this tool, mock E-scores are generated for demonstration."}
{"text": "USER: What are Z-scores in your tool?\nBOT: Z-scores represent statistical relevance of TF-target links. These are also mocked for demo purposes."}
{"text": "USER: Does your tool require internet?\nBOT: Yes, for ChatGPT summaries and ChIP-Atlas API; other modules work offline from TSV files."}
{"text": "USER: What if a TF is not found in a database?\nBOT: The tool continues processing using available databases and skips missing data gracefully."}
{"text": "USER: What file formats are supported for export?\nBOT: Results are exported in Excel (.xlsx) format using pandas."}
{"text": "USER: What is the summary fallback option?\nBOT: If GPT API fails, the summary is fetched from Wikipedia automatically."}
{"text": "USER: What kind of summaries does the tool generate?\nBOT: Short, 1-2 line functional summaries about the TF\u2019s role, domain, and disease relevance."}
{"text": "USER: Can I use this for research papers?\nBOT: Yes, the tool provides exportable, publication-ready tables and graphs."}
{"text": "USER: What data types are stored in tf_detailed_info.tsv?\nBOT: It stores TF names, targets, effects, motifs, network scores, and summaries."}
{"text": "USER: Can this tool be deployed on web?\nBOT: Yes, it can be migrated to web using frameworks like Streamlit or Dash."}
{"text": "USER: What\u2019s a common use case of this tool?\nBOT: Quick analysis of regulatory TFs in cancer, immune, or developmental studies."}
{"text": "USER: Why use TSV and TXT files?\nBOT: They provide structured yet lightweight access to large-scale TF data."}
{"text": "USER: Does your tool work for mouse or other species?\nBOT: Currently, it focuses on human TFs only. Future versions may support others."}
{"text": "USER: What is a motif ID?\nBOT: It uniquely identifies a PWM motif associated with a TF in databases like HOCOMOCO or CIS-BP."}
{"text": "USER: How do you handle errors in API calls?\nBOT: All API functions are wrapped with try-except blocks and fallback strategies."}
{"text": "USER: Can I view TFs associated with cancer?\nBOT: Yes, the tool displays TFs linked with cancer types based on AnimalTFDB data."}
{"text": "USER: Do you visualize upregulation or downregulation?\nBOT: Yes, effects like Activation and Repression are visualized in the TRRUST section and network edges."}
{"text": "USER: What are TF domains?\nBOT: They are protein regions responsible for DNA binding, typically shown in CIS-BP results."}
{"text": "USER: What if motif ID is missing?\nBOT: The PWM logo will be skipped, and the section will show 'No data available'."}
{"text": "USER: How is your tool modular?\nBOT: Each functionality is separated into Python modules like `cisbp.py`, `network_builder.py`, `chatgpt_summary.py`, etc."}
{"text": "USER: Is this tool beginner-friendly?\nBOT: Yes, it has a clean GUI, automated backend, and only requires TF name input."}
